# 🗺️ Google Maps Integration - Real Clinics Setup

## ✅ What's Been Updated

Your app now **pulls REAL hospitals and clinics from Google Maps**!

### How It Works:
1. ✅ **With Google API Key**: Shows real clinics from Google Maps
2. ✅ **Without API Key**: Falls back to location-based generated data (still shows correct city/state)

### Step 1: Get Google Maps API Key

1. Go to: **https://console.cloud.google.com**

2. **Create/Select Project**

### Step 2: Add API Key to Your App

Open your `.env` file and add this line:

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Using generated clinic data..." in console

**Cause:** Google API key not found or invalid

**Fix:**
1. Check `.env` has: `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=...`
2. Key starts with `AIzaSy...`
3. Restart dev server (`npm run dev`)
4. Check Places API is enabled in Google Cloud Console

---

### "Google Places API request failed"

**Causes:**
1. API key not activated yet (wait 5 minutes)
2. Places API not enabled
3. Billing not enabled (need credit card on file, but won't be charged)

**Fix:**
1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Check "Places API" is enabled
3. Enable billing (required but FREE tier covers you)

---

### "No results from Google Places API"

**Cause:** No clinics found in that area (rare)

**Fix:** App automatically falls back to generated data

---

### CORS / Network Errors

**Current Setup:** Using CORS proxy (allorigins.win) for demo

**For Production:** Should move API calls to backend server

**Works Fine For:**
- ✅ Hackathon demos
- ✅ Testing
- ✅ Judges reviewing
- ✅ Development

---

## 📊 What Judges Will See

### Without API Key (Still Great):
```

1234 Main Street, Austin, Texas

0.8 miles away
```

### With API Key (AMAZING):
```

[Get Directions] [Call]
```
- **Real clinic names**
- **Real addresses** (judges can verify!)

---

## 🎤 Demo Script Update

### When Showing to Judges:

> "Our clinic finder uses real-time data from Google Maps. Watch - I'm in [your city], and it shows actual free clinics and community health centers near me. These are real places with real addresses. If I click 'Get Directions,' it opens in Google Maps."

**Then show:**
1. ✅ Real clinic names from your area
2. ✅ Click "Get Directions" → Opens Google Maps
3. ✅ (Optional) Use DevTools to change location
4. ✅ Shows different real clinics!

---

## 🚀 Production Improvements

1. **Backend Proxy**
   ```
   Frontend → Your Server → Google Places API
   ```
   - More secure (hides API key)
   - No CORS issues
   - Can cache results

2. **Get Phone Numbers**
   - Use Places Details API
   - Requires additional API call
   - Shows real phone numbers

3. **Enhanced Data**
   - Opening hours (Mon-Fri 8am-5pm)
   - Reviews and ratings
   - Photos
   - Website links

4. **HRSA Integration**
   - Combine with government free clinic database
   - Mark which are federally qualified
   - Show sliding scale details
